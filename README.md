## Inspiration

This project, **"From Chains to Freedom,"** springs from a place deep within our hearts. As this was our very first **hackathon**, the excitement and eagerness to embark on this journey were immense. Faced with the challenge of choosing a historical event, the most compelling and deeply personal choice was to tell the story of our own country, Bangladesh. Our homeland's path to sovereignty is not merely a sequence of dates. it's a profound saga of unyielding resilience, of pain that carved rivers of sorrow and of a pride that now stands as resolute as the Himalayas. Coming from families whose own histories are interwoven with the valor of our freedom fighters, we felt an undeniable, almost spiritual obligation to share this narrative. This isn't just a hackathon, it's an act of remembrance, a digital homage to the indomitable spirit of our people.

## About the project

**"From Chains To Freedom"** is an interactive React-based website meticulously designed to illuminate the pivotal and often underrepresented historical events that defined Bangladesh's arduous journey to independence, focusing on the period from 1948 to 1971. Our project moves beyond surface-level narratives, offering an immersive educational platform that delves into the human cost of colonial legacies, the fervent passion of the Language Movement, the impact of systemic oppression and the stark realities of the 1971 Liberation War and genocide.
