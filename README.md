**Live Website:** [[https://fromchainstofreedom.netlify.app/]([https://fromchainstofreedom.netlify.app/](https://startling-pavlova-74c5c3.netlify.app/))](https://startling-pavlova-74c5c3.netlify.app/)

"From Chains To Freedom" is an interactive React-based website meticulously designed to illuminate the pivotal and often underrepresented historical events that defined Bangladesh's arduous journey to independence, focusing on the period from 1948 to 1971. Our project moves beyond surface-level narratives, offering an immersive educational platform that delves into the human cost of colonial legacies, the fervent passion of the Language Movement, the impact of systemic oppression, and the stark realities of the 1971 Liberation War and genocide.

This project was developed for the **Hackathon - Hackstory (Create a Website about a historical event) for DevPost Powered by BOLT**.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

"From Chains To Freedom" was built using a modern and efficient technology stack:

* **Core Framework:** React with TypeScript
* **Build Tool & Dev Server:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Routing:** React Router DOM (v6)
* **Animations & Interactivity:** Framer Motion, React Intersection Observer (for scroll effects)
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Deployment:** Netlify & GitHub pages

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started & Local Development

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Taoshif1/FromChainsToFreedom.git](https://github.com/Taoshif1/FromChainsToFreedom.git)
    cd FromChainsToFreedom
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you prefer Yarn)

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create an optimized build in the `dist` folder.

## Inspiration

This project, **"From Chains to Freedom,"** springs from a place deep within our hearts. As this was our very first hackathon, the excitement and eagerness to embark on this journey were immense. Faced with the challenge of choosing a historical event, the most compelling and deeply personal choice was to tell the story of our own country, Bangladesh. Our homeland's path to sovereignty is not merely a sequence of dates; it's a profound saga of unyielding resilience, of pain that carved rivers of sorrow and of a pride that now stands as resolute as the Himalayas. Coming from families whose own histories are interwoven with the valor of our freedom fighters, we felt an undeniable, almost spiritual obligation to share this narrative. This isn't just a hackathon entry; it's an act of remembrance, a digital homage to the indomitable spirit of our people.
